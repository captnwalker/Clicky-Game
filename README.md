# Clicky Game :mouse:

## Purpose of this project

>"Clicky-Game" is a memory game built with React. To complete this project it was neccessary to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user input events. I elected to give this project a "South Park" theme and included animated, rotating giphy's to increase the level of difficulty of the game.

### Technologies Utilized

* React
* NodeJS
* Yarn
* Bootstrap
* Google Fonts
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS

### How to Play

You will be presented with 12 icons. Attempt to click each icon without clicking the same icon twice. With each click, the icons will reshuffle making the task more difficult. I have included giphy's instead of static images to further increease the level of diffficulty.
