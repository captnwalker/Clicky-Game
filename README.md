## Purpose of this project

>"Clicky-Game" is a memory game built with React. To complete this project it was neccessary to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user input events. I elected to give this project a "South Park" theme and included animated rotating giphy's, an hypnotic background, surprising text animations for an immersive gaming experience too increase the level of difficulty of the game. You **will not** beat this game. It has been designed to beat you, psychologically! Mmmmmwwwwahahahahahahaha! :smirk:

### How to Play

>You will be presented with 16 icons. Attempt to click each icon without clicking the same icon twice. With each click the icons will reshuffle making the task more difficult. I have included giphy's instead of static images to further increase the level of difficulty.
